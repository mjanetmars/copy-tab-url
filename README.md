# Copy Tab URL

**Copy Tab URL** is a WebExt-based Firefox add-on that allows users to copy the URL of a tab from the context menu.

[The add-on is officially available here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copytaburl/)

## Known bugs

### Context menu item positioning

This is a limitation of the API, since add-ons can't choose where menu items are positioned. Hopefully this will be changed in future versions of the WebExt API.

## What's New

- **Version 0.2**
-- Fixed, modernized, new icon made.
- **Version 0.1**
-- First version of the add-on.
